bitcoinCapitalGains
===================

Calculate gains from csv input transactions, both LIFO and FIFO

Language used is Perl.

I used this for calculating the tax from my 2013 sales, and the numbers do agree with what I calculated manually in Excel.

My approach is to increase the basis or decrease the proceed amounts by hand to include costs of wire transfers, or special 5% fees imposed by MtGox for expidited cash withdrawals.

Prerequisites
  install a Perl interpretor, and obtain the TEXT.csv package from CPAN if it is not already included.
